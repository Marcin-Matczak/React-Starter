To-do app for adding and editing targets . With ability to add separate groups. Included filtering and searching for a tasks. Moreover, additional subpages for add some notes. App was written in an older version of React. I am moving it to a separate repo ( student_shelf_react_app ) and developing in the latest React 18, Redux and Router versions. Works in progress.
